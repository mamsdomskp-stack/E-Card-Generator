## Card Key Generation

Each identity card uses a unique algorithm for generating its identifier:

| Card Type | Format | Example | Generation Logic |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Aadhar | 12-digit number | 123456789012 | Random 12-digit integer |
| PAN | XJHQR3842P | XJHQR3842P | 5 uppercase letters, 4 digits, 1 uppercase letter |
| Voter ID | ABC1234567 | ABC1234567 | 3 uppercase letters + 7 digits |
| Driving License | DL-01-2025-1234567 | DL-01-2025-1234567 | 2 letters (state) + 2 digits (RTO) + year + 7 digits |
